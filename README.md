# databases-introduction
Solutions for excercises from AGH University course called Databases. During the first part of the course, participants were obliged to face with basic SQL
commands. We were practising by using sample databases called 'Northwind' and 'Library'. While the second part of the course (now) students were divided into three-person
teams. We are making project which documentation will be avaliable here soon.
