# databases-introduction
Solutions for excercises from AGH University course called Databases. During the first part of the course, participants were obliged to face with basic SQL
commands. We were practising by using sample databases called 'Northwind' and 'Library'. 

While the second part of the course students were divided into three-person
teams. We made a project which documentation is avaliable in pdf above. We were ordered to: 
create tables, database diagram, procedures, views, triggers and functions. Our work can be seen in the documentation I mentioned before.
